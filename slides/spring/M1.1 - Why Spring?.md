 # Why Spring?
 
This introductory lesson contains an overview of the Spring framework, including the benefits of using Spring and how to approach learning the [framework](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_framework).

## What is Spring?
Let's start with understanding what Spring actually is. Simply put, Spring is a [back-end](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Front_and_back_ends) technology with a broad range of uses, the most common being the development of web applications.

Spring is also a very general term which can refer to the core of the framework, but most often, it refers to the whole family of Spring-related projects.

## The Popularity of Spring
The framework is also quite dominant in the Java ecosystem.

Let's have a look at just a quick search trend: [Spring Framework Google Search Trend](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F0dhx5b)

And given that Spring was originally built in response to the complexity of developing with [J2EE](https://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javaee/appmodel-135059.html) / Java EE, let's compare it with that: [Spring Framework - Java EE Google Search Trend Comparison](https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?date=all&q=%2Fm%2F0dhx5b,Java%20EE)

As the graph shows, Spring clearly overtakes its main competitor in popularity.

Of course, today Spring is so much more than just an alternative to Java EE.

Another indication of Spring's popularity is the number of questions on StackOverflow for Spring compared to other related Java technologies:

## Why Use Spring?
The early goal of Spring, and still a core guideline of the framework, is removing complexity, clutter and boilerplate code.

Basically, Spring aims to make building a system easier for developers.

This is a monumental task, and one that, solved correctly, can make a huge impact.

Spring is also not an all or nothing choice. You can actually pick and choose the parts of Spring that make sense for your system.

## Learning Spring
An interesting aspect of Spring is how much of a long-term investment learning Spring actually is, as its evolution is quite unique.

On the one hand, it's actively developed and always improving at the edges. But, at the core, it's highly highly stable.

In fact, it's so stable that learning the core of Spring 10 years ago would, with small exceptions, still be relevant today.

In this course, we'll focus on understanding the foundational concepts of Spring, starting with the definition of a bean and what dependency injection is. Then we'll work our way through the most commonly used Spring modules, including the core, persistence, web and security modules.

As we progress through the lessons, we'll dive deeper into each Spring aspect.
