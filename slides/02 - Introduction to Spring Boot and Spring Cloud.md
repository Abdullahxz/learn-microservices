## Quickstart
Spring has become the most popular development framework for building Java-based applications. 

Spring is based on the concept of **dependency injection**. A dependency injection framework allows you to more efficiently manage large Java projects by externalizing the relationship between objects within your application through convention (and annotations) rather than hardcoding those objects to “know” about each other. Spring sits as an intermediary between the different Java classes of your application and manages their dependencies. Spring essentially lets you assemble your code like a set of Lego bricks that snap together.

**Spring Boot is a re-envisioning of the Spring framework**. While it embraces core features of Spring, Spring Boot strips away many of the “enterprise” features found in Spring and instead delivers a framework geared toward Java-based, REST-oriented (Representational State Transfer) microservices. 

The key features of Spring Boot include the following:
* An embedded web server to avoid complexity in deploying the application: Tomcat (default), Jetty, or Undertow.
* A suggested configuration to start quickly with a project (starters).
* An automatic configuration for Spring functionally—whenever it’s possible.
* A wide range of features ready for production (such as metrics, security, status verification, externalized configuration, and more).

Using Spring Boot offers the following benefits for our microservices:
* Reduces development time and increases efficiency and productivity
* Offers an embedded HTTP server to run web applications
* Allows you to avoid writing a lot of boilerplate code
* Facilitates integration with the Spring Ecosystem (includes Spring Data, Spring Security, Spring Cloud, and more)
* Provides a set of various development plugins
