# Service Routing

Spring Cloud Gateway aims to provide a simple, yet effective way to route to APIs and provide cross-cutting concerns to them such as: security, monitoring/metrics, and resiliency.

## Maven dependencies
To include a Cloud Gateway service in our ecosystem, create an empty service and add the *spring-cloud-starter-gateway*, *spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client*, *spring-boot-starter-actuator* dependencies.

```
	<dependencies>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.boot</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-boot-starter-actuator</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-netflix-eureka-client</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		<dependency>
			<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
			<artifactId>spring-cloud-starter-gateway</artifactId>
		</dependency>
		...
	</dependencies>
	<dependencyManagement>
		<dependencies>
			<dependency>
				<groupId>org.springframework.cloud</groupId>
				<artifactId>spring-cloud-dependencies</artifactId>
				<version>${spring-cloud.version}</version>
				<type>pom</type>
				<scope>import</scope>
			</dependency>
		</dependencies>
	</dependencyManagement>
```

## Configuration

Configure Spring Cloud Gateway as an Eureka client.

```
server.port: 8080
spring.application.name: gateway-service
app.eureka-server: localhost

eureka:
  client:
    serviceUrl:
      defaultZone: http://${app.eureka-server}:8761/eureka/
    initialInstanceInfoReplicationIntervalSeconds: 5
    registryFetchIntervalSeconds: 5
  instance:
    leaseRenewalIntervalInSeconds: 5
    leaseExpirationDurationInSeconds: 5
```


Configure Spring Boot Actuator for development usage.

```
management.endpoint.gateway.enabled: true
management.endpoint.health.show-details: "ALWAYS"
management.endpoints.web.exposure.include: "*"
```

Configure log levels so that we can see log messages from interesting parts of the internal processing in Spring Cloud Gateway, for example, how it decides where to route incoming requests to:

```
logging:
  level:
    root: INFO
    org.springframework.cloud.gateway.route.RouteDefinitionRouteLocator: INFO
    org.springframework.cloud.gateway: TRACE
```

## Routing rules
When it comes to configuring Spring Cloud Gateway, the most important thing is setting up the routing rules. Setting up routing rules can be done in two ways: 
* programmatically, using a Java DSL
* by configuration 

Using a Java DSL to set up routing rules programmatically can be useful in cases where the rules are stored in external storage, such as a database, or are given at runtime, for example, via a RESTful API or a message sent to the gateway. 

In more static use cases, it is convenient to declare the routes in the configuration file. **Separating the routing rules from the Java code makes it possible to update the routing rules without having to deploy a new version of the microservice**.

A route is defined by the following:
* **ID**, the name of the route
* **Destination URI**, which describes where to send a request
* **Predicates**, which select a route based on information in the incoming HTTP request
* **Filters**, which can modify both the request and/or the response

Clients make requests to Spring Cloud Gateway. If the Gateway Handler Mapping determines that a request matches a route, it is sent to the Gateway Web Handler. This handler runs the request through a filter chain that is specific to the request. 

### Routing requests to the composite-service API

```
spring.cloud.gateway.routes:
  - id: composite-service
    uri: lb://composite-service
    predicates:
      - Path=/datetime/**
```

Some points to note from the preceding code:
* **id**: composite-service: The name of the route is composite-service.
* **uri**: lb://composite-service: If the route is selected by its predicates, the request will be routed to the service that is named composite-service in the discovery service. The protocol *lb://* is used to direct Spring Cloud Gateway to use the client-side load balancer to look up the destination in the discovery service.
* **predicates**: Path=/datetime/** is used to specify what requests this route should match. ** matches zero or more elements in the path.

### Routing requests to the date and time services APIs

```
spring.cloud.gateway.routes:
  - id: time-service
    uri: lb://time-service
    predicates:
      - Path=/time/**
  - id: date-service
    uri: lb://date-service
    predicates:
      - Path=/date/**
```

Despite this practice should be avoided in production, it could be useful during development and testing to expose individual services through the gateway. With the above configuration the time and date services are exposed via the */time* and */date* endpoints.

### Routing requests to the Eureka server’s web page
```
spring.cloud.gateway.routes:
  - id: eureka-web-start
    uri: http://${app.eureka-server}:8761
    predicates:
      - Path=/eureka/web
    filters:
      - SetPath=/
  - id: eureka-web-other
    uri: http://${app.eureka-server}:8761
    predicates:
      - Path=/eureka/**
```

Eureka exposes both an API and a web page for its clients. In this case, requests sent to the edge server with the path starting with /eureka/web/ should be handled as a call to the Eureka web page and routed to http://${app.eureka-server}:8761. 

The web page will also load several web resources, such as .js, .css, and .png files. These requests will be routed to http://${app. eureka-server}:8761/eureka. 

### Routing requests with predicates and filters
To learn a bit more about the routing capabilities in Spring Cloud Gateway, we will try out host-based routing, where Spring Cloud Gateway uses the hostname of the incoming request to determine where to route the request. We will use a website for testing HTTP codes: http://httpstat.us/.

A call to http://httpstat.us/${CODE} returns a response with the ${CODE} HTTP code and a response body, also containing the HTTP code, and a corresponding descriptive text. For example:

```
curl http://httpstat.us/200 -i
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Length: 6
Content-Type: text/plain
Date: Wed, 14 Feb 2024 08:31:30 GMT
Server: Kestrel
...

200 OK%   
```

Assume that we want to route calls to http://${hostname}:8080/headerrouting as follows:
* Calls from the i.feel.lucky host should return 200 OK
* Calls from the im.a.teapot host should return 418 I'm a teapot
* Calls from all other hostnames should return 501 Not Implemented

To implement these routing rules in Spring Cloud Gateway, we can use the Host route predicate to select requests with specific hostnames, and the SetPath filter to set the desired HTTP code in the request path. This can be done as follows:

```
spring.cloud.gateway.routes:
    - id: host_route_200
      uri: http://httpstat.us
      predicates:
      - Host=i.feel.lucky
      - Path=/headerrouting/**
      filters:
      - SetPath=/200
    - id: host_route_418
      uri: http://httpstat.us
      predicates:
      - Host=im.a.teapot
      - Path=/headerrouting/**
      filters:
      - SetPath=/418
    - id: host_route_501
      uri: http://httpstat.us
      predicates:
      - Path=/headerrouting/**
      filters:
      - SetPath=/501
```

Refer to the official documentation for the full list of [predicates](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/reference/html/#gateway-request-predicates-factories) and [filters](https://cloud.spring.io/spring-cloud-gateway/reference/html/#gatewayfilter-factories).

If we want to see the routes managed by the Gateway server, we can list the routes via the *actuator/gateway/routes* endpoint on the Gateway server. This will return a:

```
curl http://localhost:8080/actuator/gateway/routes | jq

[
  {
    "predicate": "Paths: [/datetime/**], match trailing slash: true",
    "route_id": "composite-service",
    "filters": [],
    "uri": "lb://composite-service",
    "order": 0
  },
  {
    "predicate": "Paths: [/time/**], match trailing slash: true",
    "route_id": "time-service",
    "filters": [],
    "uri": "lb://time-service",
    "order": 0
  },
  {
    "predicate": "Paths: [/date/**], match trailing slash: true",
    "route_id": "date-service",
    "filters": [],
    "uri": "lb://date-service",
    "order": 0
  },
  ...
```


## Docker configuration
Add a _Dockerfile_ to containerize the service and edit the _docker-compose.yml_ file to include the service within your ecosystem.

```
  gateway:
    build: gateway-service-end
    mem_limit: 512m
    ports:
      - "8080:8080"
    environment:
      - SPRING_PROFILES_ACTIVE=docker
```


## Trying out the service gateway

### Dynamically reloading route configuration
The next thing we’ll look at when configuring routes in Spring Cloud Gateway is how to dynamically refresh routes. The ability to dynamically reload routes is useful because it allows us to change the mapping of routes without having to restart the Gateway server(s). 

When using a configuration server, if we want to add new route mappings on the fly, all we have to do is commit those changes to the Git repository where Spring Cloud Config pulls its configuration data and call the *actuator/gateway/refresh*, that will cause it to reload its route configuration.
