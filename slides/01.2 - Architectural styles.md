## What is software architecture exactly?
Architecture is clearly important. There are at least two conferences dedicated to the topic: [O’Reilly Software Architecture Conference](https://conferences.oreilly.com/software-architecture) and the [SATURN conference](https://resources.sei.cmu.edu/news-events/events/saturn/). 

There are numerous definitions of [software architecture](https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Software_architecture). My favorite definition comes from Len Bass and colleagues at the Software Engineering Institute (www.sei.cmu.edu): *The software architecture of a computing system is the set of structures needed to reason about the system, which comprise software elements, relations among them, and properties of both. - Documenting Software Architectures by Bass et al.*

An application’s architecture is its decomposition into parts (the elements) and the relationships (the relations) between those parts. Decomposition is important for a couple of reasons:
* It facilitates the division of labor and knowledge. It enables multiple people (or multiple teams) with possibly specialized knowledge to work productively together on an application.
* It defines how the software elements interact.

## The 4+1 view model of software architecture

An application’s architecture can be viewed from multiple perspectives, in the same way that a building’s architecture can be viewed from structural, plumbing, electrical, and other perspectives. Phillip Krutchen wrote a classic paper [Architectural Blueprints — The ‘4+1’ View Model of Software Architecture](www.cs.ubc.ca/~gregor/teaching/papers/4+1view-architecture.pdf). The 4+1 model, defines four different views of a software architecture. Each describes a particular aspect of the architecture and consists of a particular set of software elements and relationships between them.

The 4+1 view model is an excellent way to describe an applications’s architecture. Each view describes an important aspect of the architecture, and the scenarios illustrate how the elements of a view collaborate.

## Architectural styles
In the physical world, a building’s architecture often follows a particular style, such as Victorian, American Craftsman, or Art Deco. Each style is a package of design decisions that constrains a building’s features and building materials. 

[David Garlan and Mary Shaw - An Introduction to Software Architecture, January 1994](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/able/ftp/intro_softarch/intro_softarch.pdf), pioneers in the discipline of software architecture, and defines an architectural style as follows: 

*An architectural style, then, defines a family of such systems in terms of a pattern of structural organization. More specifically, an architectural style determines the vocabulary of components and connectors that can be used in instances of that style, together with a set of constraints on how they can be combined.*

## Monolithic VS Distributed Architectures

Architecture styles can be classified into two main types: **monolithic** (single deployment unit of all code) and **distributed** (multiple deployment units connected through remote access protocols). 

Monolithic
* Layered architecture
* Pipeline architecture
* Microkernel architecture

Distributed
* Service-based architecture
* Event-driven architecture
* Space-based architecture 
* Service-oriented architecture
* Microservices architecture

Distributed architecture styles, while being much more powerful in terms of performance, scalability, and availability than monolithic architecture styles, have significant trade-offs for this power.

## Flavours of monolithic architectures
* N-layered
* Clean
* Modular

## Benefits of Monolithic Architecture
**Simple to Develop**
As long as the monolithic approach is a standard way of building applications, any engineering team has the right knowledge and capabilities to develop a monolithic application.

**Easier debugging and testing**
Monolithic applications are much easier to debug and test. Since a monolithic application has a single code base, we can run end- to-end testing much faster.

**Simple to deploy**
When it comes to monolithic applications, you do not have to handle many deployments, just one file or directory. Easier to deploy as only a single jar/war file is deployed.

## Challenges of Monolithic Architecture
**Become Complex over time - Hard to Understand**
It becomes too large in size with time and that’s why its difficult to manage. Application grows with adding new functionalities, a monolithic codebase can become extremely large and complex.

**Hard to Making New changes**
It is harder to implement new changes in such a large and complex application with highly tight coupling. Any code change affects the whole system.

**Barrier to new technology adoption**
It is extremely problematic to apply a new technology because the entire application has to be re development due to the interlocking dependencies found in a monolith.

**Difficult to Scale**
You can't scale components independently, the only option is the scaling the whole application. You can’t scale individual components.

## When to use Monolithic Architecture
**Small team at Founding Stage** If you are a startup and your team is small like 2 to 5 members, you don't need to deal with the complexity of the high-overhead microservices architecture.

**Simple application with Predictable Scale and Complexity** 
If your application doesn’t require advanced scalability and the complexity is manageable, then a monolith architecture is the best option to start.

**Proof of Concept and Quick Launch**
Building a proof of concept, like testing a new idea on market, that means your new products will pivot and evolve a lot over time, when you figure out what will be useful to your users.

**No Microservices Expertise**
If your team has no prior experience with microservices architecture, that will really hard to ship your application effectively and timely.


## Benefits of Modular Monolithic Architecture
**Encapsulate Business Logic**
Business logics are encapsulated in Modules and it enables high reusability, while data remains consistent and communication patterns simple.

**Reusable Codes, Easy to Refactor**
For large development teams, developing modular components of an application will increase reusability. Modular components can be reused that can help teams establish a single source of truth.

**Better-Organized Dependencies**
With modular monoliths architecture, application dependencies will be more organized and visible. This will help developers to easily assess which parts of the application require which dependencies.

**Less-Complex than Microservices Architecture**
Easier to manage a modular monolith rather than hundreds of microservices, because Modular Monolithic comes with basic underlying infrastructure and operational costs low.

**Better for teams**
Easier for developers to work on different parts of the code. with Modular Monolithic architecture, we can divide our developer teams effectively and implement business requirements with minimum affect to each other.

## Challenges of Modular Monolithic Architecture
**Can't diversifying technology**
Modular monoliths don't provide all benefits of microservices. If you need to diversifying technology and language choices, you can't do it with Modular Monolithic Architecture. These types of polyglot technology stacks can't use with Modular Monolithic Architecture.

**Can't Scale and Deploy Independently**
Since the application is a single unit, it can't be scale separated parts or deploy independently like microservices. And this kind of applications has to move microservices due to reaching out scalability limits and also performance issues.

## When to use Modular Monolithic Architecture
**Strict Consistency is Mandatory Cases**
For many companies unable to make the move to microservices, due to their database and data not appreciate for distributed architecture.
For example if your application store high important data like debit on bank account, then you need strong data consistency that means your data should be correct for every time, if you got any exception you have to rollback immediately.

**Modernization**
If you already have a big complex monolithic application running, the modular monolith is the perfect architecture to help you refactor your code to get ready for a potential microservices architecture.
Instead of jumping into microservices, you can move modular monolithic without effecting your business and get benefits like speed up with a well-factored modular monolith.

**Green Field Projects**
A modular monolith allow you to learn your domain and pivot your architecture much faster than a microservices architecture. You won't have to worry about things like Kubernetes and a services mesh at day1. Your deployment topology will be drastically simplified.


## What are Microservices ?
* Microservices are small, independent, and loosely coupled services that can work together.
* Each service is a separate codebase, which can be managed by a small development team.
* Microservices communicate with each other by using well-defined APIs.
* Microservices can be deployed independently and autonomously.
* Microservices can work with many different technology stacks which is technology agnostic.
* Microservices has its own database that is not shared with other services.

## What is Microservices Architecture ?
The microservice architectural style is an approach to developing a single application as a suite of small services, each running in its own process and communicating with lightweight mechanisms, often an HTTP or gRPC API.
* Microservices are built around business capabilities and independently deployable by fully automated deployment process.
* Microservices architecture decomposes an application into small independent services that communicate over well-defined APIs. Services are owned by small, self-contained teams.
* Microservices architecture is a cloud native architectural approach in which services composed of many loosely coupled and independently deployable smaller components.
* Microservices have their own technology stack, communicate to each other over a combination of REST APIs, are organized by business capability, with the bounded contexts.
* Following Single Responsibility Principle that referring separating responsibilities as per services.


## Benefits of Microservices Architecture
**Agility, Innovation and Time-to-market**
Microservices architectures make applications easier to scale and faster to develop, enabling innovation and accelerating time-to-market for new features.

**Flexible Scalability**
Microservices can be scaled independently, so you scale out sub-services that require less resources, without scaling out the entire application.

**Small, focused teams**
Microservices should be small enough that a single feature team can build, test, and deploy it.

**Small and separated code base**
Microservices are not sharing code or data stores with other services, it minimizes dependencies, and that makes easier to adding new features.

**Easy Deployment**
Microservices enable continuous integration and continuous delivery, making it easy to try out new ideas and to roll back if something doesn’t work.

**Technology agnostic, Right tool for the job**
Small teams can pick the technology that best fits their microservice and using a mix of technology stacks on their services.

**Resilience and Fault isolation**
Microservices are fault toleranced and handle faults correctly for example by implementing retry and circuit breaking patterns.

**Data isolation**
Databases are separated with each other according to microservices design. Easier to perform schema updates, because only a single database is affected.


## Challenges of Microservices Architecture
**Complexity**
Each service is simpler, but the entire system is more complex. Deployments and Communications can be complicated for hundreds of microservices.

**Network problems and latency**
Microservice communicate with inter-service communication, we should manage network problems. Chain of services increase latency problems and become chatty API calls.

**Development and testing**
Hard to develop and testing these E2E processes in microservices architectures if we compare to monolithic ones.

**Data integrity**
Microservice has its own data persistence. Data consistency can be a challenge. Follow eventual consistency where possible.

**Deployment**
Deployments are challenging. Require to invest in quite a lot of devops automation processes and tools. The complexity of microservices becomes overwhelming for human deployment.

**Logging & Monitoring**
Distributed systems are required to centralized logs to bring everything together. Centralized view of the system to monitor sources of problems.

**Debugging**
Debugging through local IDE isn’t an option anymore. It won’t work across dozens or hundreds of services.

## When to Use Microservices Architecture
**Make Sure You Have a “Really Good Reason” for Implementing Microservices**
Check if your application can do without microservices. When your application requires agility to time-to-market with zero-down time deployments and updated independently that needs more flexibility.

**Iterate With Small Changes and Keep the Single-Process Monolith as Your “Default”**
Sam Newman and Martin Fowler offers Monolithic-First approach. Single-process monolithic application comes with simple deployment topology. Iterate and refactor with turning a single module from the monolith into a microservices one by one.

**Required to Independently Deploy New Functionality with Zero Downtime**
When an organization needs to make a change to functionality and deploy that functionality without affecting rest of the system.

**Required to Independently Scale a Portion of Application**
Microservice has its own data persistence. Data consistency can be a challenge. Follow eventual consistency where possible.

**Data Partitioning with different Database Technologies** 
Microservices are extremely useful when an organization needs to store and scale data with different use cases. Teams can choose the appropriate technology for the services they will develop over time.

**Autonomous Teams with Organizational Upgrade** Microservices will help to evolve and upgrade your teams and organizations. Organizations need to distribute responsibility into teams, where each team makes decisions and develops software autonomously.

## Fallacies of distributed computing
### Fallacy #1: The Network is reliable
Developers and architects alike assume that the network is reliable, but it is not. While networks have become more reliable over time, the fact of the matter is that networks still remain generally unreliable.

This is significant for all distributed architectures because all distributed architecture styles rely on the network for communication to and from services, as well as between services.

### Fallacy #2: Latency is zero
Latency in any distributed architecture is not zero, yet most architects ignore this fallacy, insisting that they have fast networks. Ask yourself this question: do you know what the average round-trip latency is for a RESTful call in your production environment? Is it 60 milliseconds? Is it 500 milliseconds?

Assuming an average of 100 milliseconds of latency per request, chaining together 10 service calls to perform a particular business function adds 1,000 milliseconds to the request! Knowing the average latency is important, but even more important is also knowing the 95th to 99th percentile. While an average latency might yield only 60 milliseconds (which is good), the 95th percentile might be 400 milliseconds!

### Fallacy #3: Bandwidth is infinite
Bandwidth is usually not a concern in monolithic architectures, because once processing goes into a monolith, little or no bandwidth is required to process that business request. 

However, once systems are broken apart into smaller deployment units (services) in a distributed architecture such as microservices, communication to and between these services significantly utilizes bandwidth, causing networks to slow down, thus impacting latency (fallacy #2) and reliability (fallacy #1).

### Fallacy #4: The network is secure
Most architects and developers get so comfortable using virtual private networks (VPNs), trusted networks, and firewalls that they tend to forget about this fallacy of distributed computing: the network is not secure. Security becomes much more challenging in a distributed architecture.

### Fallacy #5: The topology never changes
“This fallacy refers to the overall network topology, including all of the routers, hubs, switches, firewalls,networks, and appliances used within the overall network. Architects assume that the topology is fixed and never changes. Of course it changes. It changes all the time!

Architects must be in constant communication with operations and network administrators to know what is changing and when so that they can make adjustments accordingly to reduce the type of surprise previously described. This may seem obvious and easy, but it is not. As a matter of fact, this fallacy leads directly to the next fallacy.

### Fallacy #6: There is only one administrator
Architects all the time fall into this fallacy, assuming they only need to collaborate and communicate with one administrator. There are dozens of network administrators in a typical large company. Who should the architect talk to with regard to latency (“Fallacy #2: Latency Is Zero”) or topology changes (“Fallacy #5: The Topology Never Changes”)? 

This fallacy points to the complexity of distributed architecture and the amount of coordination that must happen to get everything working correctly. Monolithic applications do not require this level of communication and collaboration.

### Fallacy #7: Transport cost is zero
Many software architects confuse this fallacy for latency (“Fallacy #2: Latency Is Zero”). Transport cost here does not refer to latency, but rather to actual cost in terms of money associated with making a “simple RESTful call.” Architects assume (incorrectly) that the necessary infrastructure is in place and sufficient for making a simple RESTful call or breaking apart a monolithic application. It is usually not. 

Distributed architectures cost significantly more than monolithic architectures, primarily due to increased needs for additional hardware, servers, gateways, firewalls, new subnets, proxies, and so on.

### Fallacy #8: The network is homogeneous
Most architects and developers assume a network is homogeneous—made up by only one network hardware vendor. Nothing could be farther from the truth. 

Not all situations, load, and circumstances have been fully tested, and as such, network packets occasionally get lost. This in turn impacts network reliability (“Fallacy #1: The Network Is Reliable”), latency assumptions and assertions (“Fallacy #2: Latency Is Zero”), and assumptions made about the bandwidth (“Fallacy #3: Bandwidth Is Infinite”).
