# Learn Microservices

## Software
* Frameworks: spring boot
* Orchestration: docker, podman, kubernetes
* Service discovery: eureka, consul
* Service mesh: istio, linkerd, dapr, envoy
* Message queue: kafka, rabbitmq
* Caching: redis, memcached 
* Observability: prometheus/grafana, jaeger, zipkin, elasticsearch/kibana (ELK)
* Distributed database: cockroachdb, cassandra, debezium

## Books
* **Microservices Patterns; Richardson**
* **Spring Microservices in Action; Carnell, SaÃÅnchez**
* **Microservices with Spring Boot 3 and Spring Cloud; Larsson**
* Microservices AntiPatterns and Pitfalls; Richards
* Cloud Native DevOps with Kubernetes; Arundel, Domingus
* Modern DevOps Practices; Agarwal
* Practical MLOps: Operationalizing Machine Learning Models; Gift, Deza; O'Reilly

## Modules
These topics assume a decent understanding of Spring Boot 3. A dedicated course can be found at [https://github.com/nbicocchi/learn-spring-boot](https://github.com/nbicocchi/learn-spring-boot).

* Introduction to microservices
* Reactive microservices
* Event-driven async microservices
* Service discovery
* Service routing
* Centralized configuration
* Resiliency patterns (Resilience4j)
* Observability (Tracing, Metrics, Log aggregation)
* Deploying Microservices to Kubernetes
* Implementing Kubernetes Features to Simplify the Microservices Landscape
* Using a Service Mesh to Improve Observability and Management
