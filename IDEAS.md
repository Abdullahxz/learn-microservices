# Learn Microservices

## Project Ideas
Alternative microservices frameworks: 
* Quarkus
* Micronaut
* https://gokit.io/
* https://github.com/python-microservices/pyms

Containerization
* In depth introduction to Docker/Docker compose (with examples)
* In depth introduction to PodMan compose (with examples)

Design Patterns
* Patterns for container-based distributed systems https://static.googleusercontent.com/media/research.google.com/en//pubs/archive/45406.pdf
* Patterns for data management (SAGAs, API composition, CQRS, ...) https://microservices.io/patterns/data/saga.html)
* Patterns for distributed caching (Redis/Memcached)
* Patterns for event-sourcing
* Microservices decomposition strategies

Benchmarking protocols/architectures
